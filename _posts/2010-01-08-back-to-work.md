Just got back from residency orientation @ Seton Hill.  It's nice to be
back, even if it meant driving 4 hours through snow.  I had a great
break, had a couple of good reads while I was off.  First was John
Scalzi's *Old Man's War*, a very entertaining science fiction book. 
It's not my typical flavor, but it kept me reading, full of good action
and interesting characters.

My other read was *The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror, Volume 20*,
edited by Stephen Jones.  It's filled with some excellent short horror
from 2008, and definitely worth the time.  It's late, I'm tired, so I
won't do any sort of review of them, but here's a list of the one's that
appealed most to me:

-   *It Runs Beneath the Surface*, by Simon Strantzas
-   *These Things We Have Always Known*, by Lynda E. Rucker (my favorite
    of the lot)
-   *Through the Cracks*, by Gary McMahon
-   *The Camping Wainwrights*, by Ian R. MacLeod
-   *The Oram County Whoosit*, by Steve Duffy (excellent story in the
    vein of Lovecraft)
-   *The* New York Times *at Special Bargain Rates*, by Stephen King
-   *2:00 pm: The Real Estate Agent Arrives*, by Steve Rasnic Tem

That last one verges on poetic.  It's shorter than this post, a mere 3
sentences, but paints a beautifully horrific picture and punches you in
the end.  Loved it!

And now, I'm off to see if I can wrap up some stuff before getting into
the groove tomorrow.
