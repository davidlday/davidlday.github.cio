Time conducting desperatio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
running sorrow of knowing

illusory meaning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
traversing orchestral mirrors

touch destiny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
contained within<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a self made mirror of defiance

behold a lending of meaning
