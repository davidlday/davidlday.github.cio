Hide desperation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
contained from wanting illusionary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
knowing life from memory

As manifested sounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with soft chamber non-existence

behold, my own wanting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of another mirror reality
