A helpless yellow disciple of anger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
precariously fluttering against the concrete earth.

Preachers and brethren,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hung by the umbilical stalk of faith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shake and chortle.

The wavering spine of desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
snapped and severed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by the coarse sparks of flesh.

Red tenderness is found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by flames of will.
