Apollo's fissured time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
muted and screened by circumstance.

This silky night of tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
eclipses the eye in shuttered laughter.

Delicious tragedy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
life's movement a conflict<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of fractured author and masqued audience.
