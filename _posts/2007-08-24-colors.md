you sense my hesitation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
good.

This is the color of DREAM

we are children, unseeing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
we open our eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
unlocking the verse and meter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the universe.

This is the color of FORGET

it is here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
look closer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is the color

This is the color of SAD

baby girl, club-footed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
opens her eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pressed between hot sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and rough mountain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
welcomed to the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by no one.

This is the color of GREED

whatever is written here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it is not enough.

This is the color of LOVE

one plump drop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sneaks from a fang.

This is the color of DREAMS

one by one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
we close our eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no longer children.
