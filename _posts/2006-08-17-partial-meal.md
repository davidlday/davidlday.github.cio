Flesh-eating hearts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
nurtured on line-soup<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
nurse ivory anguish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that is bidden thirsty for us.

Heresy steak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
spar of the living,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where our green obligations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
announce thunderous tradition.

Coal redresses discontent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
implication,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shudders resistance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a dizzy unseen statement.

Dispatch a strip of prison veil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the hush of leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a prelude to duck failure.

Lunch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that obstructed, devoted meal.
