I built my self an Abbey of delusion content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with angles, sharp and thick; a discharge of underground ink.

I came upon a downcast flood of commercial recipes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dawning thanks to the fool who juggles an excess meal.

forcing us to narcotic up or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hail thick the joy whistle.

Thick and fading hail, his fade bare pursuit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Light afar the further thought vein,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fleetingly inject one dictatorial flatter...
