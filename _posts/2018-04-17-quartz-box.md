I have a picture of you from 1971. I keep it close.

You are dressed in a white sleeveless top and matching white stockings kneeling next to a tree. Nestled in your arms is a small, white bundle with a tuft of dark hair. Your face is turned down, but not so much that your proud, slight smile is hidden.

That bundle was me. Just shy of 46 years later, my siblings and I held your hands as you left this world. Just as I'm sure you held ours coming into it.



I never knew how to help you. You never knew how to accept help, because in order to do so would have required you to surrender control.

We buried you today. Two of my siblings were there. The third was not, and that's okay. She has her reasons. I love her still, as I'm sure you do.

We arrived at the cemetary office, and were presented with a small white box, quartz, I guess, but I don't really know. Your ashes were sealed inside at some point. We joked a little, as you would have wanted, and as we got up to go to the graveside, my brother and I exchanged questioning smirks. Were we just supposed to grab the box?

We asked, and yes, we could carry you in the car with us.

I took you in my arms one last time, a small white bundle, hard and cold, but still it was you. I held you in my lap as we drove to the site, and I placed you on the table under the tent. The three of us chatted for a bit, shared memories, joked some more, held back tears as best we could.
