Welcome 2016. I wish you'd have come sooner, but better late than never. Your predecessor started out okay, then soured about mid-way through and wound up being an outright jerk towards the end. His only redeeming quality was that he didn't get in the way of all the women I was trying to get to know.

So where shall I start? The women? The cigarrettes? No, no. Let's begin where all good storytellers should - with the hernia at end. Four years. Four long, challenging, brutal years I've been working toward my black belt in Taekwondo. Finally in November I received the news I was ready for the test on December 5. Shortly after I wound up at the doctor's office with some pain, informed I likely had an inguinal hernia, and referred to a specialist. I had suffered quite a bit of discomfort since June / July, thought it related more to diet than anything else, but no - I had a hernia. So thank you, 2015, for dangling the carrot of a black belt in front of me only to whisk it away just at the end.

You listening 2016? I expect you to stay the fuck outta my way when it comes to earning my black belt.
