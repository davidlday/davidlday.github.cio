I quit smoking this year, and like so many of the positive things in my life, this was a complete accident. My last cigarrette was on December 31, 2015. I've even kept the pack, which is still half full.

I love nicotine almost as much as I love caffeine. I'm something of a stimulant junkie (as much as the law will allow) I think in part because my natural state of being is so low key and laid back that I'm something like half-a-step behind the rest of the world, out of phase.

I started experimenting with an alternative [sleep](../../../../tags/#sleep) schedule in 2012 and trained myself to where I could work with only 4-5 hours of sleep plus two 20-minute naps per day. This bought me a solid two hours of writing time in the morning before the rest of my house wakes up. But during 2015 I started having more and more difficulty focusing during writing time. Yeah, some of this was clearly due to the hernia pain (hindsight is wonderful, eh?), but not all of it.

January 2013 brought with it a much needed job change (coincidentally around the time I started letting this site lag) and with that change came a whole new set of stressors. Don't get me wrong, the day job is pretty good. I'm lucky to have it and fortunate to be surrounded by good people, but the role challenged my networking and influencing skills in ways I didn't imagine. In pop language terms, for the past three years this introvert has been required to behave very much like an extrovert. I knew this going in, needed the challenge, but man, being something you're not is exhausting as hell.

In 2015 I looking into [nootropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic), cognitive-enhancing drugs. I started this investigation with a few ground rules: 1) no illegal substances, and 2) nothing I would be embarrassed or ashamed to share publicly.

Green Tea. I hate it. Well, maybe not hate it but I can't drink it regularly. But, it contains something




**What I want to say**: That sometimes when we're looking to fix one thing, even if we fail we might find what we tried fixes something else. We need to pay attention to ourselves in a healthy, loving way, be forgiving when we fail (because failure is a natural part of the human condition), and be aware of our successes.
