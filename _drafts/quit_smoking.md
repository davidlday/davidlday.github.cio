I quit smoking this year, and like so many of the positive things in my life, this was a complete accident. You see, I love nicotine as much as I love caffiene. In fact, I'm something of a stimulant junkie. My natural state of being is so low key and something like half-a-step behind the rest of the world, out of phase, that if I'm not careful I might get mistaken for a corpse.

But I'm not dead yet.

**What I want to say**: That sometimes when we're looking to fix one thing, even if we fail we might find what we tried fixes something else. We need to pay attention to ourselves in a healthy, loving way, be forgiving when we fail (because failure is a natural part of the human condition), and be aware of our successes.
