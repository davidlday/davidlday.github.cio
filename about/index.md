I write dark fantasy, often with a heavy helping of religious symbolism. I hold a BA in English, Creative Writing, and an MBA from Ohio University. I'm also a graduate of the [Master of Arts in Writing Popular Fiction](http://www.setonhill.edu/academics/fiction/index.cfm) program at Seton Hill University (now an MFA program).

I like scary movies. My older brother and I used to watch [Fritz the Night Owl](http://www.fritzlives.com/)'s Double Chiller Theater every Friday night. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever discovered.

I also read a lot as a kid, spending hours on end at the library reading anything dark and sticky, like candy for the brain. Now I'm all grown up, married to a lovely wife, and father to two awesome little boys. Between family, writing, and the day job I keep pretty busy. But I still make time for books and the occasional B movie.
